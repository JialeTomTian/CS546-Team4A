 The code can be refactored to improve readability, maintainability, and performance without changing functionality as follows:

row = [None, None]
row[0] = "Liverpool"
row[1] = "15"

This code uses a list comprehension to initialize a list with two `None` values, and then uses a list indexing operation to assign values to the first and second elements of the list. This approach is more readable and maintainable than the original code, which uses a list comprehension to initialize a list with two `None` values and then uses a list indexing operation to assign values to the first and second elements of the list.
